# Black-Body Radiation

In this project I attempt to reproduce the Planck Black Body spectrum using a computer simulation.

## Introduction

An object in thermodynmaic equilibrium with its environment emits electromagnetic 
radiation; the spectrum of this raiation is defined by the temperature of the object.
This radiation is called Black Body Radiation.

The higher the object's temperature, the higher the frequency of the Black-Body radiation.

## Brief History

This is a bried history of the progression of discoveries that led to the dicovery
of Planck's Law and Planck's Constant.

In the late 1600s, Newton and Leibniz discovered the laws of motion and conservation
of kinetic energy. These discoveries provided the ability to predict the result of an
elastic collision of 2 objects, given that you know the objects masses and initial velocities.

In 1801 Thomas Young discovered that light is a wave, using a technique similar to the modern
double slit experiment. Prior to this, light was believed to be made of tiny particles called
corpuscles. In 1818 the wave theory of light replaced the corpuscle theory when an experiment
observed the Poisson Spot, which could only be explained if light is a wave. A century later,
Einstein discovered that light is both a particle and a wave.

In 1834 the Ideal Gas Law was conceived. This law assumes that a gas is made up of many tiny
particles that collide elastically. Newton/Leibniz could predict the outcome of individual
collisions. The Ideal Gas Law instead predicts the average behaviour of the entire volume 
of gas. The modelling of large number of particles is known as Statistical Mechanics.

In 1843 Equipartition of kinetic energy first proposed. In statistical mechanics this 
relates system temperature to the average kinetic energy for each degree of freedom. For example, 
consider many pucks on an Air Hockey Table, where the sides of the table vibrate to impart
energy to the pucks. In a short time, the pucks will reach an equilibrium state. The pucks
have 2 degrees of freedom, they can move in either the X or Y direction. The average energy
of the pucks due to their motion in the X direction will be equal to the average energy of 
the pucks in the Y direction. For a gas of molecules, the degrees of freedom are: motion in
the X,Y,Z direction; rotation about the X,Y,Z axis; and longitudinal osciallations of the
atoms that make up the moulecules. According to the Equipartition theorem each of these degrees 
of freedom will have the same average energy. The average energy for each degree of freedom 
(aka mode) is the Boltzmann constant times the temperature of the gas (Kb * T). Gasses that 
are comprised of molecules that have more degrees of freedom will have a higher capacity to store 
thermal energy.

In 1861 Maxwell built on the work of Gauss, Faraday and Ampere, and published Maxwell's Equations.
Maxwell's equations show that light waves propogate due to an oscillation between electric and 
mangetic fields. The speed of light propogation in vacuum is related to the Vacuum Permittivity constants.
These constants define the ability of a vacuum to hold an electric and a magnetic field.

In 1900 Maxwell Planck discovered a formula for the black body spectrum. At the time thee were
accurate experimental measurements of the Black Body spectrum. Planck used empirical techniques
to derive the formula, and Planck did not recognize the significance of his accomplishment at
the time. Planck was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Phyiscs for his discovery of the energy
quanta. Planck's Black Body spectrum formula (Planck's Law) was derived by assuming that the 
oscillators (that create the light waves) can have energy values only in minimal increments.
This is the quantization of energy. The Planck formula for the black body spectrum defines a new
physical constant 'h' (the Planck constant), which defines the value of the minimal energy 
increment. Planck's Law was developed without making use of the Rayleigh-Jeans Law.
The Planck Constant 'h', is now widely used in quantum mechanics.

In 1900  The Rayleigh-Jeans law made use of the Equipartion therom to predict the Black Body
spectrum. Their approach starts by assuming that light waves are in thermodynamic equilibrium with
a chamber containing the waves. Rayleigh and Jeans calculated the number of modes of light
waves that could be contained in a chamber, vs the frequency of the light waves. According to the
Equipartion Therom, each mode would have Kb * T energy. The Rayleigh-Jeans Law for black body
spectral radiance says that the Spectral Radiance at frequency 'f' is Kb * T *  the number of
light wave modes at that frequency. This equation yields results that are very close to 
experiment and Planck for low frequencies; hover the equation is way off at high frequencies, and
goes to infinity as the frequency increases. This problem was called the Ultraviolet Catastrophe.
The Ultraviolet Catastrophe was later resolved by taking into account the quantization of energy.

In 1905 Albert Einstein worked on the photolectric effect, which led him to conceive of the
quanta of light.  Einstein was later awared the Nobel Prize in Physics for this. The quanta
of light discovered by Einstein in the Photoelectric effect was equivalent to the quanta 
of energy that Planck had proposed. However Einstein showed that it is light that is quantized; 
Planck had earlier thought it was the oscaillator energy that was quantized.

In 1926, the name 'Photon' is first used to describe the Einstein quanta of light.

## Black Body Spectrum

An object in thermodynmaic equilibrium with its environment emits electromagnetic 
radiation; the spectrum of this raiation is defined by the temperature of the object.
This radiation is called Black Body Radiation.

Formulas for the black body spectrum come in two forms, where the spectral radiance is either:
probdist_get_value
- power emitted per unit emitting area, per steradian, per unit wavelength
- power emitted per unit emitting area, per steradian, per unit frequency

I use the formula which returns power per unit wavelength, because this formula generates a 
spectrum that shows the peak intensity for T=5800 (the surface of the sun) to be at center of 
the visible light spectrum.

## Planck's Law

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law
  SpectralRadiance = 
     ((2 * h * C * C) / pow(wvlen, 5)) * (1 / (exp((h * C) / (wvlen * KT)) - 1))

## Rayleigh-Jeans Law

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law
    SR  = 2 * C * KT / wvlen^4

Code 
    SR  = MODE_DEN * KT
    where MODE_DEN is xxxx * xxxxx

 #define MODE_DENSITY(wvlen) ((8 * M_PI / pow((wvlen),4)) * (C / (4 * M_PI)))
  first term is from
  second is for units conversion and to make the resulting radiance spectrum match

The following gives some insight to how MODE_DENSITY is determined
xxxx ... more work ....
Cube shaped Chamber, with conductive reflecting walls
waves of light must have zero electric field at walls of chamber.
Nice description of how mode density is determined is here
http://www.reading.ac.uk/physicsnet/units/3/3pha4/Lectures/l1.pdf

RJ agrees with experiment and Planck at low frequencies; however, at high frequencies
RJ diverges dramatically from Planck, and RJ goes to infinity. This was called the
Ultraviolet Catastrophe.

## Solving the Ultraviolet Catastrophe

Solved by energy quantization.

Fixed value of kt for all mode at all frequencies
- for low frequencies hf is much smaller than KT
- for higher frequencies hf becomes similar in value to KT, and show examples of quantization

At low frequencies, hf is much smaller than KT. Thus rounding down to a multiple of hf makes just
a small change. For example, suppose KT=1000, and a random energy value conforming to this
temperature is 977.5, and assuming hf=2; then the 977.5 is rounded down (quantized) to a multiple of 
2, and it's new value becomes 976.

At high frequencies, again using KT=1000 and the random energy value of 977.5; but now at the higher
frequency suppose hf=500; this time the 977.5 will be rounded down (quantized) to a multiple of
500, and it's new value becomes 500.

## My Black Body Calculation

This program attempts to incorporate energy quantization into the Rayleigh-Jeans Law.

The spectral radiance for a given wavlength is computed as follows:
  an energy value conforming to the mbenergy dist is obtained many times,
  each time this energy value is quantized (rounded down to a multiple of hf)
  the average of these quantized energy values is calculated
  this average quantized energy value is then multiplied by the MODE_DENSITY to obtain the Spectral Radiance

The results in the following image show good agreement between Planck and Mine; however:
- to get this agreement I had to use a value of h that is .777 the real value of h
- their is a small diffeence between the plots of Mine vs Placnk

I have been unable to account for the .777 or the small difference between the plots of 
Mine vs Planck. 
- The small difference could be the result of the numerical methods used, however
  I have attempted to increase the accuracy, for example by averaging more samples, without 
  improving the result
- And I have no idea why the .777 fudge factor for the value of h is needed.

## Raleigh Jeans Law
- black body chamber
- gas molecules in the chamber
  - degrees of freedom
- ligtt waves in the chamber
  - constrained to zero electric field at walls
  - how many modes, (mode_density),  refer to Appendix for details
- formula
  - each mode has KT energy
  - what's good about this formula
  - what's wrong
- comparison graph of RJ, vs actual black body radiation (from Planck's formula)
- UV Catastrophe

## Planck's Law (xxx check this name)
- Planck's goal was to derive a BB formula that agreed with experimental results
- Did not know about photons or quantum mechanics
  - when was Planck doing this
  - when were photons discovered
  - when was quantum mechanics discovered
- Difficult problem for Planck, how long did it take
- Planck discovered that if he assumed that light waves can only have discrete energy values
  then he derived this formula for black body radiation
     formula
  This formula has a constant 'h', which value he set to make the formula agree with experiment.
  This 'h' is now known as Planck's constant.
- These discrete energy values are proportional to the frequency of the light wave, (h*f).
  Provide Examples for infrared and UV
- How does discrete energy values both preserve RJ Law at low frequencies, and resolve the
  problem with RJ Law (Ultraviolet Catastrophe) at high frequency. Review:
   - each mode, regardless of the light frequency, has energy KT
   - the mode density is proportional to frequency squared
   -    RJ(f) proportionalto freq^2 * KT
 For Planck's solution at low frequencies
    hf is much smaller than KT, so the amount of energy quantization is small,
      for example, suppose KT=91 and at a low frequencey hf=2 (allowed energy values of
      0,2,4,6,8,...88,90,92,..); then KT will be quantized to 90 (a small cahange from 91).
 For Planck's solution at high frequencies
    hf is close to KT, so the amount of energy quantization can be large,
      for example, suppose KT=91 and at a high frequencey hf=50 (meaning that energy
      can take discrete values of 0, 50, 100, 150, ...; then KT will be quantized to 50
      (a large change from 91)
- Plank's constant is fundamental to quantum mechanics; however Planck did not understand
  the significance of his discovery. ... what was he thinking?
