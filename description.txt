Planck's Law (check this name)
- Planck's goal was to derive a BB formula that agreed with experimental results
- Did not know about photons or quantum mechanics
  - when was Planck doing this
  - when were photons discovered
  - when was quantum mechanics discovered
- Difficult problem for Planck, how long did it take
- Planck discovered that if he assumed that light waves can only have discrete energy values
  then he derived this formula for black body radiation
     formula
  This formula has a constant 'h', which value he set to make the formula agree with experiment.
  This 'h' is now known as Planck's constant.
- These discrete energy values are proportional to the frequency of the light wave, (h*f).
  Provide Examples for infrared and UV
- How does discrete energy values both preserve RJ Law at low frequencies, and resolve the
  problem with RJ Law (Ultraviolet Catastrophe) at high frequency. Review:
   - each mode, regardless of the light frequency, has energy KT
   - the mode density is proportional to frequency squared
   -    RJ(f) proportionalto freq^2 * KT
 For Planck's solution at low frequencies
    hf is much smaller than KT, so the amount of energy quantization is small,
      for example, suppose KT=91 and at a low frequencey hf=2 (allowed energy values of
      0,2,4,6,8,...88,90,92,..); then KT will be quantized to 90 (a small cahange from 91).
 For Planck's solution at high frequencies
    hf is close to KT, so the amount of energy quantization can be large,
      for example, suppose KT=91 and at a high frequencey hf=50 (meaning that energy
      can take discrete values of 0, 50, 100, 150, ...; then KT will be quantized to 50
      (a large change from 91)
- Plank's constant is fundamental to quantum mechanics; however Planck did not understand
  the significance of his discovery. ... what was he thinking?

My simulation version 1
- similar to RJ formula but replace KT with quantized value
     KT_quantized = xxxxxxxx
- show graph

My simulation version 2
- describe improvement
- show graph
