# Black-Body Radiation

In this project I attempt to reproduce the Planck Black Body spectrum using a computer simulation.

## Introduction

An object in thermodynmaic equilibrium with its environment emits electromagnetic 
radiation; the spectrum of this raiation is defined by the temperature of the object.
This radiation is called Black Body Radiation.

The higher the object's temperature, the higher the frequency of the Black-Body radiation.

## Brief History

This is a bried history of the progression of discoveries that led to the dicovery
of Planck's Law and Planck's Constant.

1687  Newton's Laws of Motion
1689  Leibniz, vis viva, Kinetic Energy
1801  Young Double Slit Experiment
1834  Ideal Gas Law
1843  Equipartition of kinetic energy first proposed
1861  Maxwell's Equations
1900  Planck's Law , empirically derived, uses quantized energy
1900  Rayleigh Jeans law, based on thermodynamics
1905  Einstein conceived of quanta of light, Photoelectric Effect
1918  Max Planck awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the enegy quanta
1921  Albert Einstein awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the Photoelectirc Effect
1926  The name 'Photon' is used to describe Einstein's quanta of light

In the late 1600s, Newton and Leibniz discovered the laws of motion and conservation
of kinetic energy. These discoveries provided the ability to predict the result of an
elastic collision of 2 objects, given that you know the objects masses and initial velocities.

In 1801 Thomas Young discovered that light is a wave, using a technique similar to the modern
double slit experiment. Prior to this, light was believed to be made of tiny particles called
corpuscles. In 1818 the wave theory of light replaced the corpuscle theory when an experiment
observed the Poisson Spot, which could only be explained if light is a wave. A century later,
Einstein discovered that light is both a particle and a wave.

In 1834 the Ideal Gas Law was coneived. This law assumes that a gas is made up of many tiny
particles that collide elastically. Newton/Leibniz could predict the outcome of individual
collisions. The Ideal Gas Law instead predicts the average behaviour of the entire volume 
of gas. The modelling of large number of particles is known as Statistical Mechanics.

In 1843 xxx equipartion

In 1861 Maxwell built on the work of Gauss, Faraday and Ampere, and published Maxwell's Equations.
Maxwell's equations show that light waves propogate due to an oscillation between electric and 
mangetic fields. The speed of light propogation is related to the Vacuum Permittivity constants.
These constants define the ability of a vacuum to hold an electric field and a magnetic field.

In 1900 Maxwell Planck discovered a formula for the black body spectrum. At the time thee were
accurate experimental measurements of the Black Body spectrum. Planck used empirical techniques
to derive the formula, and Planck did not recognize the significance of his accomplishment at
the time. Planck was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Phyiscs for his discovery of the energy
quanta. Planck's Black Body spectrum formula was derived by assuming that the energy of the 
oscillators (that create the light waves) can have energy values only in minimla increments.
This is the quantization of energy. The Planck formula for the black body spectrum defines a new
physical constant 'h' (the Planck constant), which defines the value of the minimal energy 
increment.

In 1905 Albert Einstein conceived of the quanta of light, as a result of his work on the
Photoelectric Effect. Einstein was later awared the Nobel Prize in Physics for this. This 
quanta of light energy was equivalent to the quanta of energy that Planck had proposed. However
Einstein showed that it is light that is quantized; Planck had earlier thought it was
the oscaillator energy that was quantized.

In 1926, the name 'Photon' is first used to describe the Einstein quanta of light.

The Planck Constant 'h', is very important and widely used in quantum mechanics.

## Planck Law

The Planck constant is a fundamental physical constant. It was discovered in 1900
by Max Planck. Max Planck used this constant in an empirically derived formula for the
black body radiation spectrum.

## Raleigh Jeans Law

# Calculating Black-Body Spectrum 
what i did ....

## Equipartition theorem

## Raleigh Jeans Law
- black body chamber
- gas molecules in the chamber
  - degrees of freedom
- ligtt waves in the chamber
  - constrained to zero electric field at walls
  - how many modes, (mode_density),  refer to Appendix for details
- formula
  - each mode has KT energy
  - what's good about this formula
  - what's wrong
- comparison graph of RJ, vs actual black body radiation (from Planck's formula)
- UV Catastrophe

## Planck's Law (xxx check this name)
- Planck's goal was to derive a BB formula that agreed with experimental results
- Did not know about photons or quantum mechanics
  - when was Planck doing this
  - when were photons discovered
  - when was quantum mechanics discovered
- Difficult problem for Planck, how long did it take
- Planck discovered that if he assumed that light waves can only have discrete energy values
  then he derived this formula for black body radiation
     formula
  This formula has a constant 'h', which value he set to make the formula agree with experiment.
  This 'h' is now known as Planck's constant.
- These discrete energy values are proportional to the frequency of the light wave, (h*f).
  Provide Examples for infrared and UV
- How does discrete energy values both preserve RJ Law at low frequencies, and resolve the
  problem with RJ Law (Ultraviolet Catastrophe) at high frequency. Review:
   - each mode, regardless of the light frequency, has energy KT
   - the mode density is proportional to frequency squared
   -    RJ(f) proportionalto freq^2 * KT
 For Planck's solution at low frequencies
    hf is much smaller than KT, so the amount of energy quantization is small,
      for example, suppose KT=91 and at a low frequencey hf=2 (allowed energy values of
      0,2,4,6,8,...88,90,92,..); then KT will be quantized to 90 (a small cahange from 91).
 For Planck's solution at high frequencies
    hf is close to KT, so the amount of energy quantization can be large,
      for example, suppose KT=91 and at a high frequencey hf=50 (meaning that energy
      can take discrete values of 0, 50, 100, 150, ...; then KT will be quantized to 50
      (a large change from 91)
- Plank's constant is fundamental to quantum mechanics; however Planck did not understand
  the significance of his discovery. ... what was he thinking?

## My Black Body Version 1
