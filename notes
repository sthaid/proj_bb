Boltzmann distribution
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution
- The Boltzmann distribution should not be confused with the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution 
  or Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. The Boltzmann distribution gives the probability that a 
  system will be in a certain state as a function of that state's energy,[6] while the 
  Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions give the probabilities of particle speeds or energies in 
  ideal gases.
